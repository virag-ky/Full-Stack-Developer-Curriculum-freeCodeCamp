    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 x 53g Mars bars, chopped</li>
      <li>100g butter, chopped</li>
      <li>3 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
      <li>75g (1/2 cup) self-raising flour</li>
      <li>50g (1/2 cup) cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 160C/140C fan forced. Grease a square 18cm cake pan
        and line the base with baking paper, extending up 2 sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the chopped Mars and butter in a heatproof bowl and stand the
        bowl over a pan of simmering water (donâ€™t let the bowl touch the water).
        Heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter and chocolate have melted
        but lumps of nougat remain. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool
        slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the egg to the chocolate mixture and stir to combine. Sift in the
        flour and cocoa powder. Fold to combine. Transfer the mixture to the
        prepared pan, smoothing the top. Bake for 30 minutes or until a skewer
        inserted into the middle of the brownie comes out with crumbs clinging
        slightly. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Use the paper to lift
        the brownie from the pan and cut into squares. Serve warm or at room
        temperature.
